# Quick Start Guide

This guide helps you get the Smart University Platform running quickly.

---

## Prerequisites

- **Docker Desktop** (Windows/Mac) or **Docker + Docker Compose** (Linux)
- **Git** for cloning the repository

---

## Option 1: Docker Compose (Recommended)

### Start Everything

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd smart-university

# Start all services
docker compose up --build
```

### Access Points

| Service | URL | Credentials |
|---------|-----|-------------|
| Frontend SPA | http://localhost:3000 | - |
| API Gateway | http://localhost:8080 | - |
| RabbitMQ UI | http://localhost:15672 | guest / guest |
| Redis | localhost:6379 | - |

### Stop Everything

```bash
docker compose down
```

---

## Option 2: Windows Scripts

```cmd
# Start platform
scripts\start-platform.bat

# Start in detached mode
scripts\start-platform.bat -d

# Run tests
scripts\run-tests.bat

# Clean Docker resources
scripts\docker-cleanup.bat
```

### PowerShell Testing Scripts

```powershell
# Check health of all services
.\scripts\check-health.ps1

# Run full API test suite
.\scripts\test-api.ps1
```

These scripts provide:
- **check-health.ps1**: Verifies all microservices, databases, Redis, and RabbitMQ are running
- **test-api.ps1**: Automated end-to-end testing of all API endpoints

📖 For detailed test scenarios, see **[Testing Guide](testing-guide.md)**.

---

## Option 3: Linux/macOS Scripts

```bash
# Make scripts executable (once)
chmod +x scripts/*.sh

# Start platform
./scripts/start-platform.sh

# Start in detached mode
DETACH=1 ./scripts/start-platform.sh

# Run tests
./scripts/run-tests.sh
```

## Troubleshooting

### Docker Issues

**Problem:** Services fail to start
```bash
# Clean up and restart
docker compose down -v
docker compose up --build
```

**Problem:** Port already in use
```bash
# Check what's using the port
netstat -ano | findstr :8080  # Windows
lsof -i :8080                 # Linux/Mac

# Kill the process or change the port in docker-compose.yml
```

**Problem:** Out of disk space
```bash
# Clean Docker resources
scripts\docker-cleanup.bat --all  # Windows
docker system prune -a -f         # Any OS
```

### Database Issues

**Problem:** Database connection errors
```bash
# Restart just the databases
docker compose restart auth-db booking-db market-db payment-db exam-db notification-db dashboard-db
```

### RabbitMQ Issues

**Problem:** Messages not being delivered
1. Open http://localhost:15672
2. Login with guest/guest
3. Check the "Queues" tab for message counts
4. Check the "Exchanges" tab for `university.events`

### Frontend Issues

**Problem:** API calls failing
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify API Gateway is running: http://localhost:8080/actuator/health
3. Check CORS settings if running frontend separately

### Test Issues

**Problem:** Tests failing with "ApplicationContext" errors
```bash
# Clean build artifacts
scripts\clean-all.bat  # Windows
rm -rf */target        # Linux/Mac

# Rebuild
docker compose build --no-cache
```
