# Smart University Testing Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for testing all features of the Smart University platform.

## Prerequisites

- **Windows**: Docker Desktop installed and running
- **VSCode**: For viewing logs and making edits
- **PowerShell**: For running test scripts

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Start All Services

```powershell
cd your-project-folder
docker compose down -v
docker compose up -d --build
```

Wait 2-3 minutes for all services to initialize.

### 2. Verify Services Are Running

```powershell
.\scripts\check-health.ps1
```

Expected output: All services showing "✅ UP"

### 3. Open Frontend

```powershell
start http://localhost:3000
```

## Automated API Testing

### PowerShell (Windows)

```powershell
.\scripts\test-api.ps1
```

This script will:
- Register a new test user
- Login and obtain JWT token
- Test all API endpoints
- Display summary results
- Provide test credentials for browser testing

### Bash (Linux/Mac)

```bash
chmod +x scripts/test-api.sh
./scripts/test-api.sh
```

---

## Verify Redis Caching

```powershell
# Connect to Redis
docker exec -it redis redis-cli

# List all cached keys
KEYS *

# Check product cache
GET productsByTenant::engineering

# Monitor cache activity
MONITOR
```

---

## Verify RabbitMQ Events

1. Open RabbitMQ UI: http://localhost:15672
2. Login: `guest` / `guest`
3. Go to "Exchanges" tab
4. See `order.events` and `exam.events` exchanges
5. Trigger events (order, exam start) and watch message flow

---

## Service Health Indicator

The frontend navbar shows a real-time service health indicator:
- 🟢 Green dot: All services healthy
- 🟡 Amber dot (pulsing): Some services down
- Click to expand and see individual service status

---

## Troubleshooting

### Services Not Starting

```powershell
# View logs for specific service
docker compose logs -f auth-service

# Restart a single service
docker compose restart marketplace-service

# Full reset
docker compose down -v
docker compose up -d --build
```

### Frontend Not Connecting

Check that Gateway is running:
```powershell
curl http://localhost:8080/actuator/health
```

### Redis Cache Issues

```powershell
# Clear all cache
docker exec -it redis redis-cli FLUSHALL
```
