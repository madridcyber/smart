# Smart University Microservices Platform

A production-style **Smart University Management Platform** built as a set of Spring Boot microservices with a React + TypeScript SPA frontend.  
This project follows the specification of the _SAD-Project-V1(140401).pdf_ and implements:

- **Auth & User Service** – registration, login, JWT.
- **Booking & Resource Service** – room/lab resources and reservations with **no overbooking**.
- **Marketplace Service** – products and checkout with **Saga orchestration**.
- **Payment Service** – Saga participant with **Strategy** pattern for payment methods.
- **Exam & E-Learning Service** – exams and submissions with **State** + **Circuit Breaker**.
- **Notification Service** – event-driven **Observer** for orders and exams.
- **Dashboard / IoT Service** – live sensors and shuttle tracking.
- **API Gateway** – Spring Cloud Gateway with central JWT validation and RBAC.
- **React SPA** – single-page application consuming the gateway.

This repository is organised as a **Maven multi-module monorepo** for backend services and a separate frontend project.

## Backend Modules

- `common-lib` – shared DTOs and event models (no shared persistence).
- `gateway-service` – Spring Cloud Gateway, JWT validation, routing, RBAC.
- `auth-service` – user registration and login.
- `booking-service` – resources and reservations.
- `marketplace-service` – catalog and order Saga orchestrator.
- `payment-service` – payment Saga participant with Strategy pattern.
- `exam-service` – exam lifecycle, submissions, Circuit Breaker.
- `notification-service` – event-driven notifications.
- `dashboard-service` – IoT-style sensors and shuttle tracking.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Java 17, Spring Boot 3, Spring Cloud, Spring Security, Spring Data JPA, Spring AMQP, Resilience4j.
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL (one database per service).
- **Caching**: Redis (distributed cache for product listings).
- **Messaging**: RabbitMQ (topic exchange, Observer-style events).
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Vite, React Router, Axios.
- **Build & Infra**: Maven, Docker, docker-compose.

## Running the Backend (Local Dev)

1. Ensure you have **JDK 17+**, **PostgreSQL**, and **RabbitMQ** available, or use `docker-compose` (see below).
2. Build all backend modules:

   ```bash
   mvn clean verify
   ```

3. Run individual services from your IDE or via Maven, for example:

   ```bash
   # in separate terminals
   mvn -pl gateway-service spring-boot:run
   mvn -pl auth-service spring-boot:run
   mvn -pl booking-service spring-boot:run
   mvn -pl marketplace-service spring-boot:run
   mvn -pl payment-service spring-boot:run
   mvn -pl exam-service spring-boot:run
   mvn -pl notification-service spring-boot:run
   mvn -pl dashboard-service spring-boot:run
   ```

   Make sure each service has access to its PostgreSQL database and RabbitMQ instance as configured in its `application.yml`.

## Running the Frontend (Local Dev)

1. Install Node.js (18+ recommended).
2. Install dependencies and start the dev server:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

3. By default, the frontend assumes the API Gateway is reachable at `http://localhost:8080`.
   - You can override this by setting `VITE_API_BASE_URL` (e.g. `VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080`).

## Running the Full Stack with Docker

This repository provides a `docker-compose.yml` that starts:

- RabbitMQ (with management UI).
- A PostgreSQL database per service (auth, booking, market, payment, exam, notification, dashboard).
- All backend microservices.
- The API Gateway.
- The React SPA served via Nginx.

### Prerequisites

- Docker and docker-compose installed.
- Built backend JARs (each service Dockerfile expects its fat JAR in `target/`).

Build the backend:

```bash
mvn clean package
```

This will produce JARs under each module's `target/` directory (e.g. `auth-service/target/auth-service-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`).

### Start everything

From the repository root you have two options:

#### Option 1 – Using the helper script (recommended)

**On Linux/macOS/Git Bash:**
```bash
chmod +x scripts/start-platform.sh   # once
./scripts/start-platform.sh          # build + docker compose up --build
```

**On Windows (Command Prompt/PowerShell):**
```cmd
scripts\start-platform.bat           # build + docker compose up --build
scripts\start-platform.bat -d        # run in detached mode
```

Environment flags (Linux/macOS/Git Bash only):

- `DETACH=1` – run `docker compose up` in detached mode.

#### Option 2 – Manual docker compose

Build and start everything (Docker multi-stage builds handle Maven internally):

**On any OS:**
```bash
docker compose up --build
```

#### Running Tests

**On Linux/macOS/Git Bash:**
```bash
chmod +x scripts/run-tests.sh   # once
./scripts/run-tests.sh
```

**On Windows (Command Prompt/PowerShell):**
```cmd
scripts\run-tests.bat
```

Key endpoints:


- API Gateway: http://localhost:8080
- Frontend SPA: http://localhost:3000
- RabbitMQ management UI: http://localhost:15672 (guest/guest)

### End-to-End Usage Walkthrough

Once `docker-compose up --build` is running:

1. Open the SPA at **http://localhost:3000**.

2. **Register a teacher user**

   - Go to **Register**.
   - Choose a username (e.g. `teacher1`).
   - Choose a password.
   - Set **Tenant / Faculty** to e.g. `engineering`.
   - Set **Role** to `TEACHER`.
   - Submit the form – you are automatically logged in after successful registration.

3. **Teacher: explore Dashboard**

   - Go to **Dashboard**.
   - Observe:
     - Live sensor cards (temperature, humidity, CO₂, energy).
     - Shuttle position moving within the pseudo-map.
   - Data is per-tenant (here: `engineering`), updated by scheduled jobs in the Dashboard service.

4. **Teacher: create a resource and book it**

   - Switch to **Booking**.
   - Initially, the list may be empty (or contain seeded resources if you added any).
   - As a TEACHER/ADMIN, you can add resources via backend, or pre-seed via DB; by default, the UI shows existing resources.
   - Select a resource from the list in the reservation form.
   - Pick a `Start time` and `End time` using the datetime inputs.
   - Click **Request reservation**.
   - Booking Service will:
     - Check for overlapping reservations within a transaction.
     - Reject overlapping requests with **409 Conflict** (no overbooking).
   - The UI shows a success or “slot already booked” message.

5. **Teacher: create marketplace products**

   - Go to **Marketplace**.
   - As TEACHER/ADMIN, a **Create product** form is visible at the top.
   - Fill in:
     - Product name (e.g. `Algorithms Textbook`).
     - Description (e.g. `CS fundamentals`).
     - Price and initial stock.
   - Submit:
     - The product is created via `POST /market/products`.
     - The product list is automatically updated and cached per tenant.

6. **Student: register and buy products (Saga flow)**

   - Log out and register a new **STUDENT** user (e.g. `student1`) with the same tenant (`engineering`).
   - Log in as this student.
   - Go to **Marketplace**:
     - You see the products created by the teacher (tenant-scoped).
   - You now have two options:
     - **Quick buy**: click **Buy 1** on a product:
       - SPA sends `POST /market/orders/checkout` with a single item (`quantity: 1`).
       - Saga orchestrator in Marketplace:
         - Creates a `PENDING` order.
         - Calls Payment Service to authorise.
         - Decrements stock with pessimistic locking.
         - Marks order `CONFIRMED` and publishes `order.confirmed` event.
     - **Cart checkout**: adjust quantities using the inputs next to each product, click **Add to cart** for multiple products, then click **Checkout cart**:
       - SPA sends `POST /market/orders/checkout` with multiple items and quantities.
       - The same Saga orchestrates payment, stock decrement, and compensation if any item is out of stock.
   - The UI displays a success message or appropriate error (e.g. insufficient stock or simulated payment failure).
   - Notification Service consumes the `order.confirmed` event and logs a `NotificationLog` entry.

7. **Teacher: create and start an exam**

   - Log back in as `teacher1`.
   - Go to **Exams**.
   - Fill in the **Exam title** and a single **Question**.
   - Click **Create exam**:
     - Calls `POST /exam/exams`, creating a `SCHEDULED` exam.
     - The exam ID is shown below the form.
   - Click **Start exam**:
     - Exam Service uses the State pattern to move from `SCHEDULED` → `LIVE`.
     - It calls Notification Service via a **Resilience4j Circuit Breaker**:
       - On success: HTTP call logs a notification.
       - On failure: fallback logs an error, but the exam still starts.
     - Exam Service publishes `ExamStartedEvent` to RabbitMQ.
     - Notification Service also logs the event.

8. **Student: load exam and submit answers**

   - Log in as `student1`.
   - Go to **Exams**.
   - In the student section:
     - Paste the exam ID that the teacher created and started.
     - Click **Load exam**.
     - The SPA calls `GET /exam/exams/{id}` through the gateway and displays the exam title and questions.
     - Enter your answers for the displayed questions.
     - Click **Submit answers**.
   - Exam Service:
     - Verifies the exam is in `LIVE` state.
     - Creates a `Submission` tied to your student id and tenant.
     - Prevents duplicate submissions for the same exam/student.

9. **Dashboard: monitor ongoing activity**

   - With any logged-in user in the same tenant, return to **Dashboard**.
   - The SPA periodically polls:
     - `/dashboard/sensors` for live metrics.
     - `/dashboard/shuttle` for shuttle position.
   - The Dashboard service persists sensor readings and shuttle locations in its own PostgreSQL database and updates them via scheduled jobs, so responses are fast and consistent while remaining durable across restarts.

> **Note on demo data**  
> When running via `docker-compose`, the `demo` profile seeds initial data for the `engineering` tenant:
> - Booking: `Room 101` and `Lab A` resources.
> - Marketplace: `Campus Notebook` and `Algorithms Textbook` products.
> - Exam: a `Sample Demo Exam` in `SCHEDULED` state.
> You can inspect the seeded exams via the Exam Service Swagger UI (`http://localhost:8085/swagger-ui.html`, `GET /exam/exams`) or by calling `GET /exam/exams` through the gateway.
